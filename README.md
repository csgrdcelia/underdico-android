#### Realtime game
Users can create public or private rooms. If private, the creator has to give a secret code to his friends.

Player has 30 seconds to guess the expression based on the displayed definition. If he submits a wrong answer or is too slow, the next user plays. The next user is randomly defined, so a player can play twice in a row ;)
